CHAPTER 4: WEBSITE DESIGN PRINCIPLES

Group A: Short Questions

1. Ans => Legibility is the ease with which individual letters and characters can be recognized. It depends on the font style, size, and spacing.

Readability is the ease with which words, sentences, and paragraphs can be read and understood. It depends on word choice, sentence length, and text organization.


2. Ans => Rule of Thirds is a layout design principle where a page is divided into three equal parts horizontally and vertically (3×3 grid). Important content is placed along these lines or at their intersections to create a balanced, attractive, and easy-to-focus design.

Group B: Long Questions

5. Ans => The F-Pattern is a common eye-movement pattern that users follow while reading web pages. Studies show that people scan web pages in the shape of the letter F instead of reading word by word.

Pattern:

First, users scan horizontally across the top part of the page.

Then they move slightly down and scan another horizontal line.

Finally, they scan vertically down the left side of the page.

Influence on Content Placement:

Important headings and key information should be placed at the top and left side.

Logos, navigation menus, and main messages are placed in the top-left area.

Paragraphs should start with important words because users read mainly the first few words.

Call-to-action buttons are placed near these scanning paths to get more attention.

This pattern helps designers arrange content in a way that matches natural user behavior.


6. Ans => Colors affect human emotions and behavior. Proper use of color can increase user trust, attention, and interaction.

Blue

Red
